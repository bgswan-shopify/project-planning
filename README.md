# Project planning & tracking  

Trying out ideas around planning and tracking.

## Projects

* Each project has a github project board
* Project board represents a release (GSD)
* Column per sprint
* Items are user stories
* User story is a GitHub issue
* Issue has title, description, acceptance criteria and task break down
* Task is checkbox, description, handle of who is working on it
* Add PR once in review
* Checked once merged

## Release Planning
* Beginning of a new project/release
* Represents the GSD phases
* Create stories for release (include non-engineering work as well)
* Distribute stories into sprints/iterations

## Sprint Planning
For each project 
* Review/Demo done stories
* Revise release plan based on completed stories
* Agree stories for next sprint
* Break stories into tasks
* Build task board for the sprint

## Task board
* One column per story
* One note per task

## Daily standup
* Delete done tasks
* Add any new unplanned tasks
* Ask "are we still confident we can deliver the planned stories"
* Revise sprint plan as needed (remove/split stories)

## Handling non-project work
* Create a "keeping  the lights on" project
* Add a new column each sprint
* Add an issue for each non-project item worked on during the sprint. This also provides a place to document the issue.
* Add a column to the task board for any unplanned stories
* Ideally create a copy of the issue in each sprint column if it spans multiple sprints
