# Project planning & tracking  

Trying out ideas around planning and tracking.

## Projects
* Each [project](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/1) has a github project board
* Project board represents a release (GSD)
* Column per sprint
* Items are user stories

## User Stories
* User story is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/issues/1)
* Issue has title, description, acceptance criteria and task break down
* Close issue once story is complete
* Optionally use Milestones for GSD phases

## Tasks
* Task is a checkbox item on the associated issue
* Description, handle of who is working on it
* Add PR link once in review
* Checked once merged
* Also add [note](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/1#card-23197101) on the task board

## Release Planning
* Beginning of a new project/release
* Includes all GSD phases
* Create stories for release (include non-engineering work as well)
* Distribute stories into sprints

## Sprint Planning
For each project 
* Review/Demo done stories
* Revise release plan based on completed stories
* Agree stories for next sprint
* Break stories into tasks
* Build [task board](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/2) for the sprint

## Task board
* Seperate project for [task board](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/2)
* One column per story
* One note per task

## Daily standup
* Delete notes for done tasks on the task board
* Add any new unplanned tasks
* Ask "are we still confident we can deliver the planned stories"
* Revise sprint plan as needed (add/remove/split stories)

## Handling non-project work
* Create a "[keeping the lights on](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/3)" project
* Add a new column each sprint
* Add an issue for each non-project item worked on during the sprint. This also provides a place to document the issue.
* Add a column to the task board for any unplanned stories

## Handling long-running stories
* Ideally split the story so that part can be delivered
* Use a label to indicate a blocked story
* If the story continues for more than one sprint, [create a note](https://github.com/bgswan-shopify/project-planning/projects/3#card-23198002) that links to the story in the current sprint and move the story card to the next sprint
